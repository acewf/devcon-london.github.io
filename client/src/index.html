  <h2>Welcome.</h2>

  <p>Devcon.London is a gathering of top-level developers in London. We periodically meet for drinks and tech talks, mainly in the Shoreditch area.</p>
  <p>Group membership is by invitation only and we are working to update this website and provide a form to register your interest.</p>
  <p>Seriously, we are.</p>
